# HW2 - Computer Vision Assignment

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques for **image classification**, comparing the effectiveness of classical algorithms like **kNN** with **neural networks (CNNs)**.

## Goals:
- Train and evaluate **kNN** and **CNN** models on the MNIST dataset.
- Compare **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, training time,** and **confusion matrices**.
- Analyze the **advantages and limitations** of both approaches.
